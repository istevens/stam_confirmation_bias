Preamble

Kofi, a nurse in a maternity ward, tells his friends that more babies are born
during a full moon. "Why, just last week it was crazy busy and I look outside
to see — sure enough — a full moon!" Kofi doesn't notice that during the next
full moon the ward is quiet.

As a child, Lee lived outside of London, England. Her father had it in for
the Welsh, and Lee grew to share his views. "They're always trouble, can't trust
'em," she says to a co-worker, Bill. Bill points out that two respected members
of their team are from Wales, but Lee is dismissive. "They're the good ones,
not like the others," she says.

What it is
==========

.. Need a snappier intro to draw reader in

Confirmation bias is one of many cognitive biases which affect how we reason.
Unlike a leaning or a slant, like left- or right-wing bias, cognitive biases
are the result of involuntary mental "short cuts". [Brief example] These short
cuts may have helped our ancestors quickly distinguish friend from foe, but
they impede logic and accuracy necessary in our modern world.[NELSON2013]_

While there are many cognitive biases, confirmation bias likely does us the
most harm. It leads us to hold false beliefs with a confidence greater than
evidence can justify.[NICKERSON1998]_ Those affected will often misinterpret
new information as supporting a previously-held belief.[RABIN1999]_ In this
way, confirmation bias tricks us into accepting falsehoods and nurtures them
until we are certain they are true.

Before confirmation bias had a name, people were thought to be largely
rational. Any errors in judgement were often blamed on improper empirical
methods.[LARRICK2004]_ In his recount of the Peloponnesian War, Thucydides
(460BC-395BC) called confirmation bias a "habit"::

    "… for it is a habit of mankind to entrust to careless hope what they long
    for, and to use sovereign reason to thrust aside what they do not fancy.

Sir Francis Bacon (1561-1626) was more inclined to treat confirmation bias as a
phenomenon of the mind::

    "The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion (either as
    being the received opinion or as being agreeable to itself) draws all
    things else to support and agree with it."

It wasn't until 1960, when psychologist Peter Wason performed his first
selection experiment, that confirmation bias was studied and named.

Wason's experiment was simple: present a subject with three numbers (ie.
2-4-6), and ask him/her to identify a rule for the three numbers. The subjects
were then asked to pick three other numbers which fit their supposed rule, and
were told whether their numbers fit the actual rule. Although the actual rule
was "any ascending sequence", subjects would often come up with rules specific
to the initial triplet (eg. "numbers increasing by two") and would often only
pick triplets which confirmed their rule, never triplets which would disconfirm
it. As we will learn later, improper selection of evidence is one tendency
contributing to confidence bias.

Since Wason's experiment, many studies have shown that not only do we hold
systematic biases, they are robust to corrective measures.[LARRICK2004]_ We as
individuals are largely unaware of our own confirmation bias. Worse, although
our reasoning about information is sometimes subject to bias, supporting
existing beliefs, we rationally apply that information to our own state of the
world. Ignorant to our own bias, further reasoning based on our beliefs is
tainted. While our bias-influenced reasoning may be internally coherent, it
results in sub-optimal decisions. Because we are unaware we are applying a
biased view of the world yet feel we are being rational, we can become
overconfident in our beliefs, and further reinforce our bias. [JONES2000]_
[RABIN1999]_


Why we should care
==================

Rabin 1999::
    - teachers misread pupils performance as supporting initial impressions (inner city exper. p.8)
    - cite above study
    - ppl supporting prior sterotypes

Nelson 2013::
    - "smart people" still have problems with CB
    - cite this study specifically, summarise
    - "women are more risk averse than men" claim from studies
        - finding confirms popular stereotype as men as brave and adventurous
            - but what if affected by CB

Bian 2017::
    - tie with above
    - At 5, both boys and girls associated brilliance with their own gender to a similar extent
    - Girls aged 6-7 were significantly less likely to associate brilliance with their own gender
    - Leading girls to be less interested in games labelled for "really, really smart" children
    - YET girls disassociate brilliance with school smarts

Nickerson 1998::
    - perceptions are influenced by seeing what we are led to expect (with
      example of horoscopes)
    - seeing or remembering behaviour we expect feeds
        - stereotypes, prejudice, hypochondria, paranoia
    - depressed ppl focus on info which strengthens depression and ignore more
      positive info [Beck 78]
    - also brand identity [Chernev 97]
    - stereotyping (eg. specific behaviours more common with some groups)
        - illusory correlation
        - unusual behaviours in distinct group more readily recalled
    - overweighing positive instances
        - open to exploitation, eg. mind reader, horoscopes, psychics, gamblers
        - ppl believe universally positive traits apply to themselves
        - will focus on these rather than what doesn't because they want to believe
        - will not consider universality
        - draw from experience with friends
        - will strengthen belief, leading to overconfidence


Why it develops
===============

Does learning truly converge on optimizing behaviour?
