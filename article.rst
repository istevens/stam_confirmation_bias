Preamble
========

Kofi, a nurse in a maternity ward, tells his friends that more babies are born
during a full moon. "Why, just last week it was crazy busy and I look outside
to see — sure enough — a full moon!" Kofi doesn't notice that during the next
full moon the ward is quiet.

As a child, Lee lived outside of London, England. Her father had it in for
the Welsh, and Lee grew to share his views. "They're always trouble, can't trust
'em," she says to a co-worker, Bill. Bill points out that two respected members
of their team are from Wales, but Lee is dismissive. "They're the good ones,
not like the others," she says.
