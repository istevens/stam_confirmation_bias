Preamble
========

Kofi, a nurse in a maternity ward, tells his friends that more babies are born
during a full moon. "Why, just last week it was crazy busy and I look outside
to see — sure enough — a full moon!" Kofi doesn't notice that during the next
full moon the ward is quiet.

As a child, Lee lived outside of London, England. Her father had it in for
the Welsh, and Lee grew to share his views. "They're always trouble, can't trust
'em," she says to a co-worker, Bill. Bill points out that two respected members
of their team are from Wales, but Lee is dismissive. "They're the good ones,
not like the others," she says.

how it grows and sticks with us,
why it develops, and
how to fight back.

What it is
==========

cognitive biases…not a leaning or slant as with left- or right-wing bias
more like a mental tendency or inclination

Francis Bacon (1561-1626)::
    "The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion (either as
    being the received opinion or as being agreeable to itself) draws all
    things else to support and agree with it."

Thucydides (460BC-400BD)::
    "When a man finds a conclusion agreeable, he accepts it without argument,
    but when he finds it disagreeable, he will bring against it all the forces
    of logic and reason."

Rabin 1999::
    - ppl have cognitive bias that leads them to misinterpret new info as
      supporting previously held beliefs
    - induces overconfidence

Nelson 2013::
    - cognitive short cuts
    - required to quickly sort potentially dangerous from benign (class things into kinds)
    - OK for survival but not for logic and accuracy
    - p27 has cites

Nickerson 1998::
    - inappropriate bolstering of beliefs whose truth is in question
    - impartial evaluation vs. "building a case" (deliberate, see slant above)
    - deliberate vs. unwitting (where conf bias falls)
    - motivated (by desire to defend beliefs) vs. unmotivated (no personal interest, CB can still exist)
    - ppl prone to treat evidence in biased ways if issue at hand matters to them
    - many beliefs may be held with a strength or degree of certainty which exceeds what evidence justifies

Why we should care
==================

Larrick 2004::
    - prior (esp economists and philosophers): ppl rational and errors due to
      improper empirical methods (Stanovich 1999)
    - now (esp decision researchers): systematic biases exist and are robust to corrective measures

Rabin 1999::
    - economists assumed ppl begin with subjective beliefs over different
      states of the world and use Bayes' Rule to update beliefs
    - reality: unaware of misreading but updated rationally

Jones 2000::
    - economics assumes agents are rational optimizers through repeated experience and optimization
    - psychologists: reasoning subject to positive confirmation bias

    Bias results in pattern of reasoning
        - leads to sub-optional decisions
        - internally coherent
        - self-reinforcing

Nickerson 1998::
    - ppl find it easy to stick with beliefs formed with false info even after info shown to be fictious [Ross 1982]

Klayman 1995::
    - ambiguity supports biased hypothesis
    - limited resources for all cognitive tasks => easiest course of action
    - bias towards the positive => cognitive failure [Evans 1989]
        eg. positive correlations between cues easier to learn [Klayman 1988]


Why it develops
===============

Does learning truly converge on optimizing behaviour?
