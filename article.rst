Preamble

Kofi, a nurse in a maternity ward, tells his friends that more babies are born
during a full moon. "Why, just last week it was crazy busy and I look outside
to see — sure enough — a full moon!" Kofi doesn't notice that during the next
full moon the ward is quiet.

As a child, Lee lived outside of London, England. Her father had it in for
the Welsh, and Lee grew to share his views. "They're always trouble, can't trust
'em," she says to a co-worker, Bill. Bill points out that two respected members
of their team are from Wales, but Lee is dismissive. "They're the good ones,
not like the others," she says.

What it is
==========

.. Need a snappier intro to draw reader in

Confirmation bias is one of many cognitive biases which affect how we reason.
Unlike a leaning or a slant, like left- or right-wing bias, cognitive biases
are the result of involuntary mental "short cuts". These short cuts may have
helped our ancestors quickly distinguish friend from foe, but they impede logic
and accuracy necessary in our modern world.[NELSON2013]_

While there are many cognitive biases, confirmation bias likely does us the
most harm. It leads us to hold false beliefs with a confidence greater than
evidence can justify.[NICKERSON1998]_ Those affected will often misinterpret
new information as supporting a previously-held belief.[RABIN1999]_ In this
way, confirmation bias tricks us into accepting falsehoods and nurtures them
until we are certain they are true.

Before confirmation bias had a name, people were thought to be largely
rational. Any errors in judgement were often blamed on improper empirical
methods.[LARRICK2004]_ In his recount of the Peloponnesian War, Thucydides
(460BC-395BC) called confirmation bias a "habit"::

    "… for it is a habit of mankind to entrust to careless hope what they long
    for, and to use sovereign reason to thrust aside what they do not fancy.

Sir Francis Bacon (1561-1626) was more inclined to treat confirmation bias as a
phenomenon of the mind::

    "The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion (either as
    being the received opinion or as being agreeable to itself) draws all
    things else to support and agree with it."

It wasn't until 1960, when psychologist Peter Wason performed his first
selection experiment, that confirmation bias was studied and named.

Wason's experiment was simple: present a subject with three numbers (ie.
2-4-6), and ask him/her to identify a rule for the three numbers.  The subjects
were then asked to pick three other numbers which fit their supposed rule, and
were told whether their numbers fit the actual rule. Although the actual rule
was "any ascending sequence", subjects would often come up with rules specific
to the initial triplet (eg. "numbers increasing by two") and would often only
pick triplets which confirmed their rule, never triplets which would disconfirm
it. As we will learn later, improper selection of evidence is one tendency
contributing to confidence bias.

.. notes
   Rabin 1999::
       - ppl have cognitive bias that leads them to misinterpret new info as
         supporting previously held beliefs
       - induces overconfidence

   Nelson 2013::
       - cognitive short cuts
       - required to quickly sort potentially dangerous from benign (class things into kinds)
       - OK for survival but not for logic and accuracy
       - p27 has cites

   Nickerson 1998::
       - inappropriate bolstering of beliefs whose truth is in question
       - impartial evaluation vs. "building a case" (deliberate, see slant above)
       - deliberate vs. unwitting (where conf bias falls)
       - motivated (by desire to defend beliefs) vs. unmotivated (no personal interest, CB can still exist)
       - ppl prone to treat evidence in biased ways if issue at hand matters to them
       - many beliefs may be held with a strength or degree of certainty which exceeds what evidence justifies

Why we should care
==================

Larrick 2004::
    - prior (esp economists and philosophers): ppl rational and errors due to
      improper empirical methods (Stanovich 1999)
    - now (esp decision researchers): systematic biases exist and are robust to corrective measures

Rabin 1999::
    - economists assumed ppl begin with subjective beliefs over different
      states of the world and use Bayes' Rule to update beliefs
    - reality: unaware of misreading but updated rationally

Jones 2000::
    - economics assumes agents are rational optimizers through repeated experience and optimization
    - psychologists: reasoning subject to positive confirmation bias

    Bias results in pattern of reasoning
        - leads to sub-optional decisions
        - internally coherent
        - self-reinforcing

Nickerson 1998::
    - ppl find it easy to stick with beliefs formed with false info even after info shown to be fictious [Ross 1982]

Klayman 1995::
    - ambiguity supports biased hypothesis
    - limited resources for all cognitive tasks => easiest course of action
    - bias towards the positive => cognitive failure [Evans 1989]
        eg. positive correlations between cues easier to learn [Klayman 1988]

Bian 2017::
    - At 5, both boys and girls associated brilliance with their own gender to a similar extent
    - Girls aged 6-7 were significantly less likely to associate brilliance with their own gender
    - Leading girls to be less interested in games labelled for "really, really smart" children
    - YET girls disassociate brilliance with school smarts

Why it develops
===============

Does learning truly converge on optimizing behaviour?
