Preamble
========

Kofi, a nurse in a maternity ward, tells his friends that more babies are born
during a full moon. "Why, just last week it was crazy busy and I look outside
to see — sure enough — a full moon!" Kofi doesn't notice that during the next
full moon the ward is quiet.

As a child, Lee lived outside of London, England. Her father had it in for
the Welsh, and Lee grew to share his views. "They're always trouble, can't trust
'em," she says to a co-worker, Bill. Bill points out that two respected members
of their team are from Wales, but Lee is dismissive. "They're the good ones,
not like the others," she says.


What it is
==========

    Rabin 1999::
        - ppl have cognitive bias that leads them to misinterpret new info as
          supporting previously held beliefs
        - induces overconfidence

    Nelson 2013::
        - cognitive short cuts
        - required to quickly sort potentially dangerous from benign (class things into kinds)
        - OK for survival but not for logic and accuracy
        - p27 has cites

    Nickerson 1998::
        - inappropriate bolstering of beliefs whose truth is in question
        - impartial evaluation vs. "building a case" (deliberate, see slant above)
        - deliberate vs. unwitting (where conf bias falls)
        - motivated (by desire to defend beliefs) vs. unmotivated (no personal interest, CB can still exist)
        - ppl prone to treat evidence in biased ways if issue at hand matters to them
        - many beliefs may be held with a strength or degree of certainty which exceeds what evidence justifies

    Larrick 2004::
        - prior (esp economists and philosophers): ppl rational and errors due to
          improper empirical methods (Stanovich 1999)
        - now (esp decision researchers): systematic biases exist and are robust to corrective measures

    Rabin 1999::
        - economists assumed ppl begin with subjective beliefs over different
          states of the world and use Bayes' Rule to update beliefs
        - reality: unaware of misreading but updated rationally

    Jones 2000::
        - economics assumes agents are rational optimizers through repeated experience and optimization
        - psychologists: reasoning subject to positive confirmation bias

        Bias results in pattern of reasoning
            - leads to sub-optional decisions
            - internally coherent
            - self-reinforcing

    Nickerson 1998::
        - ppl find it easy to stick with beliefs formed with false info even after info shown to be fictious [Ross 1982]

    Klayman 1995::
        - ambiguity supports biased hypothesis
        - limited resources for all cognitive tasks => easiest course of action
        - bias towards the positive => cognitive failure [Evans 1989]
            eg. positive correlations between cues easier to learn [Klayman 1988]

Why we should care
==================

    Rabin 1999::
        - teachers misread pupils performance as supporting initial impressions (inner city exper. p.8)
        - cite above study
        - ppl supporting prior sterotypes
    Nelson 2013::
        - "smart people" still have problems with CB
        - cite this study specifically, summarise
        - "women are more risk averse than men" claim from studies
            - finding confirms popular stereotype as men as brave and adventurous
                - but what if affected by CB
    Bian 2017::
        - tie with above
        - At 5, both boys and girls associated brilliance with their own gender to a similar extent
        - Girls aged 6-7 were significantly less likely to associate brilliance with their own gender
        - Leading girls to be less interested in games labelled for "really, really smart" children
        - YET girls disassociate brilliance with school smarts
    Nickerson 1998::
        - perceptions are influenced by seeing what we are led to expect (with
          example of horoscopes)
        - seeing or remembering behaviour we expect feeds
            - stereotypes, prejudice, hypochondria, paranoia
        - depressed ppl focus on info which strengthens depression and ignore more
          positive info [Beck 78]
        - also brand identity [Chernev 97]
        - stereotyping (eg. specific behaviours more common with some groups)
            - illusory correlation
            - unusual behaviours in distinct group more readily recalled
        - overweighing positive instances
            - open to exploitation, eg. mind reader, horoscopes, psychics, gamblers
            - ppl believe universally positive traits apply to themselves
            - will focus on these rather than what doesn't because they want to believe
            - will not consider universality
            - draw from experience with friends
            - will strengthen belief, leading to overconfidence
