Preamble
========

Kofi, a nurse in a maternity ward, tells his friends that more babies are born
during a full moon. "Why, just last week it was crazy busy and I look outside
to see — sure enough — a full moon!" Kofi doesn't notice that during the next
full moon the ward is quiet.

As a child, Lee lived outside of London, England. Her father had it in for
the Welsh, and Lee grew to share his views. "They're always trouble, can't trust
'em," she says to a co-worker, Bill. Bill points out that two respected members
of their team are from Wales, but Lee is dismissive. "They're the good ones,
not like the others," she says.


What it is
==========

    Rabin 1999::
        - ppl have cognitive bias that leads them to misinterpret new info as
          supporting previously held beliefs
        - induces overconfidence

    Nelson 2013::
        - cognitive short cuts
        - required to quickly sort potentially dangerous from benign (class things into kinds)
        - OK for survival but not for logic and accuracy
        - p27 has cites

    Nickerson 1998::
        - inappropriate bolstering of beliefs whose truth is in question
        - impartial evaluation vs. "building a case" (deliberate, see slant above)
        - deliberate vs. unwitting (where conf bias falls)
        - motivated (by desire to defend beliefs) vs. unmotivated (no personal interest, CB can still exist)
        - ppl prone to treat evidence in biased ways if issue at hand matters to them
        - many beliefs may be held with a strength or degree of certainty which exceeds what evidence justifies

    Larrick 2004::
        - prior (esp economists and philosophers): ppl rational and errors due to
          improper empirical methods (Stanovich 1999)
        - now (esp decision researchers): systematic biases exist and are robust to corrective measures

    Rabin 1999::
        - economists assumed ppl begin with subjective beliefs over different
          states of the world and use Bayes' Rule to update beliefs
        - reality: unaware of misreading but updated rationally

    Jones 2000::
        - economics assumes agents are rational optimizers through repeated experience and optimization
        - psychologists: reasoning subject to positive confirmation bias

        Bias results in pattern of reasoning
            - leads to sub-optional decisions
            - internally coherent
            - self-reinforcing

    Nickerson 1998::
        - ppl find it easy to stick with beliefs formed with false info even after info shown to be fictious [Ross 1982]

    Klayman 1995::
        - ambiguity supports biased hypothesis
        - limited resources for all cognitive tasks => easiest course of action
        - bias towards the positive => cognitive failure [Evans 1989]
            eg. positive correlations between cues easier to learn [Klayman 1988]

Why we should care
==================

    Rabin 1999::
        - teachers misread pupils performance as supporting initial impressions (inner city exper. p.8)
        - cite above study
        - ppl supporting prior sterotypes
    Nelson 2013::
        - "smart people" still have problems with CB
        - cite this study specifically, summarise
        - "women are more risk averse than men" claim from studies
            - finding confirms popular stereotype as men as brave and adventurous
                - but what if affected by CB
    Bian 2017::
        - tie with above
        - At 5, both boys and girls associated brilliance with their own gender to a similar extent
        - Girls aged 6-7 were significantly less likely to associate brilliance with their own gender
        - Leading girls to be less interested in games labelled for "really, really smart" children
        - YET girls disassociate brilliance with school smarts
    Nickerson 1998::
        - perceptions are influenced by seeing what we are led to expect (with
          example of horoscopes)
        - seeing or remembering behaviour we expect feeds
            - stereotypes, prejudice, hypochondria, paranoia
        - depressed ppl focus on info which strengthens depression and ignore more
          positive info [Beck 78]
        - also brand identity [Chernev 97]
        - stereotyping (eg. specific behaviours more common with some groups)
            - illusory correlation
            - unusual behaviours in distinct group more readily recalled
        - overweighing positive instances
            - open to exploitation, eg. mind reader, horoscopes, psychics, gamblers
            - ppl believe universally positive traits apply to themselves
            - will focus on these rather than what doesn't because they want to believe
            - will not consider universality
            - draw from experience with friends
            - will strengthen belief, leading to overconfidence


Why it develops and persists
============================

.. notes
    JONES2000::
        - psychologists: reasoning subject to positive confirmation bias
            - ie. test of belief tends to search for confirming evidence, not disconfirming evidence [Becker1963]
            - eg. Wason 1968 with vowel => even # on reverse
            - cite study
        # despite cost to acquire info, strong evidence of positive conf in info acquisition
        # info interpreted as confirming hypothesis increases subject's confidence in its truth
            - even if information has no value
                => positive confirmation not simple error, but internally coherent pattern of reasoning
        # positive confirmation may have a considerable degree of robustness to experience
            - ppl learn value of looking for disconfirming evidence but seek confirmations with no info value
        - Wason card experiment
            - those who turned over q card had confidence increased with uninformative data

    KLAYMAN1995::
        # search for evidence
            - positive test strategies (eg. Wason 2-4-6) do not uncover false negatives
            - subjects confident based on inconclusive data
            - pref for extremity (want info on highly likely/unlikely features)
            - pref for tests which better distinguish alternatives (eg. prefer A or B)?
            - bias potential exists only if one fails to appreciate consequences
                - blind spot OK so long as one knows
        # interpretation of evidence
            - ambiguous evidence (vague, open to interpretation)
                - ppl tend to give hyp benefit of doubt, eg. brand loyalty
            - discount disconfirming evidence esp if data believed to be subject to error (Gorman1981)
                - fake news?
            - feature-positive effects
            - overweight confirming and pseudodiagnostic evidence
            - Bayes' law not widely understood
                - ppl believe p(D|H) alone good enough
                - eg. actions taken, not actions not taken
        - motivation to maintain self esteem and others' view of self
            - be accurate vs. belief preference
                - need more evidence to give up existing hyp than if neutral
            - painful to challenge
                - bad to be wrong
                - courage of one's convictions

    RABIN1999::
        - ppl who form initial hyp from weak evidence
            - have difficulty correctly interpreting subsequent, better info which contradicts
                - due to propensity to recall strengths of confirming, weaknesses of disconfirming
                - due to tendency to judge confirming evidence as reliable and relevant, disconfirming as opposite
                - due to accepting confirming evidence at face value and scrutinizing disconfirming evidence hypercritically
        - contributions:
            # interpret ambigious evidence (unlike visual tasks) => CB and overconfidence
                - need degree of abstraction
                - eg. teacher interpreting student as having creative or stupid answers
            # when ppl must interpret statistical evidence for correlation
                - ppl often imagine correlation between events if no correlation exists (eg. sugar => hyperactivity)
                - ppl underestimate correlation if hold no existing theory
                    - and exaggerate correlation if preconceived theory
            # when ppl selectively collect or scrutinize evidence
                - ppl tend to ask questions likely to be true if theory is true
                  without considering if likely to be true even if hyp is false

    NELSON2013::
        - may take only one observation of a difference to add a new "essential" characteristic to a group
        - drive to essentialize to strong that
          generic statements => universal, individual memmbers of class [Khemlani 2009]
        - misinterpretation of stats results somewhat due to tendency to [Bakan 1966]
            - go from sample results in sample aggregate to inferences on population aggregate (Fisherian unfoundedness)o               - eg. "X are more Y than Z" from "statistically significant difference in mean Y"

    NICKERSON1998::
        # restrict attention of favored hypothesis (even if other opposing beliefs known)
            - p(D|H) vs. p(D|~H)
            - ppl do not consider pseudodiagnosticity
        # preferential treatment of evidence supporting hypothesis
            - give greater weight to favoured hyp
            - fail to recall or produce reasons for competing side
            - have belief as we can think of/recall more reasons to support
            - more likely to rate one-sided arguments higher than two-sided arguments
        # seeking only or mostly positive cases
            - find patterns where they are not
            - selective testing
                - test hyp on examples as if hyp already correct
                - no discovery
                - eg. Wason 2-4-6
                - tie into test cases written after code?
                - tend to ask questions whose answer is yes if hyp true
                    - eg. extrovert/introvert
        # seeing what one is looking for
            - askers see answers supportive of hyp
            - answerers influenced by interviewer
            - expectation guided change vs. expectation-interpreted belief
                - eg. low/high-class student with identical tape
            - seeing or remembering expected behaviour
            - belief that 2 vars related
                => increase chances of locating confirming evidence
                => decrease chancees of locating disconfirming evidence
                - illusory correlation
        # overweighing positive confirmatory instances
            - ppl generally require less hyp-consistent evidence to accept
              than hyp-inconsistent evidence to reject
            - depends on degree of confidence and importance of drawing correct conclusion
            - FACTORS: needs for self esteem, control, and cognitive consistency
            # selective attention to what is true, ignore/discount what is not
            # consider only P(D|H), not P(D|~H) (eg. gamblers explain away losses)
            - people fail to apply contrapositive
            - ppl believe P=>Q ~ Q=>P or ~ iff P=>
            - ppl check if consequent is true when antecedent is true
        # primacy effect - info acquired early carries more weight
            - eg. blurry slides of Bruner 1964
            - ppl more likely to question info conflicting pre-existing belief
              than info consistent with pre-existing belief
            - ppl more likely to see ambiguous info as confirming hyp than disconfirming it
                => 2 ppl can see opposing opinion in same info
                - and explain away events inconsistent with prior belief
            - ppl find it easy to stick with beliefs formed with faluse info even after info shown to be false [ROSS82]
                - fake news

    LARRICK2004::
        - ppl have basic stats/logic/econ knowledge but may not know how and when to apply
        - ppl reason more accurately about frequency than probability
            - eg. Bayes
