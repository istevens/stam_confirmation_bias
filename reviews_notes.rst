Preamble

Kofi, a nurse in a maternity ward, tells his friends that more babies are born
during a full moon. "Why, just last week it was crazy busy and I look outside
to see — sure enough — a full moon!" Kofi doesn't notice that during the next
full moon the ward is quiet.

As a child, Lee lived outside of London, England. Her father had it in for
the Welsh, and Lee grew to share his views. "They're always trouble, can't trust
'em," she says to a co-worker, Bill. Bill points out that two respected members
of their team are from Wales, but Lee is dismissive. "They're the good ones,
not like the others," she says.


What it is
==========

    Rabin 1999::
        - ppl have cognitive bias that leads them to misinterpret new info as
          supporting previously held beliefs
        - induces overconfidence

    Nelson 2013::
        - cognitive short cuts
        - required to quickly sort potentially dangerous from benign (class things into kinds)
        - OK for survival but not for logic and accuracy
        - p27 has cites

    Nickerson 1998::
        - inappropriate bolstering of beliefs whose truth is in question
        - impartial evaluation vs. "building a case" (deliberate, see slant above)
        - deliberate vs. unwitting (where conf bias falls)
        - motivated (by desire to defend beliefs) vs. unmotivated (no personal interest, CB can still exist)
        - ppl prone to treat evidence in biased ways if issue at hand matters to them
        - many beliefs may be held with a strength or degree of certainty which exceeds what evidence justifies

    Larrick 2004::
        - prior (esp economists and philosophers): ppl rational and errors due to
          improper empirical methods (Stanovich 1999)
        - now (esp decision researchers): systematic biases exist and are robust to corrective measures

    Rabin 1999::
        - economists assumed ppl begin with subjective beliefs over different
          states of the world and use Bayes' Rule to update beliefs
        - reality: unaware of misreading but updated rationally

    Jones 2000::
        - economics assumes agents are rational optimizers through repeated experience and optimization
        - psychologists: reasoning subject to positive confirmation bias

        Bias results in pattern of reasoning
            - leads to sub-optional decisions
            - internally coherent
            - self-reinforcing

    Nickerson 1998::
        - ppl find it easy to stick with beliefs formed with false info even after info shown to be fictious [Ross 1982]

    Klayman 1995::
        - ambiguity supports biased hypothesis
        - limited resources for all cognitive tasks => easiest course of action
        - bias towards the positive => cognitive failure [Evans 1989]
            eg. positive correlations between cues easier to learn [Klayman 1988]
